Files related to teh movement and egg-laying simulation model

These files are a record of the development monarch movement and egg-laying simulation model.  Subsequent development or projects may also be included, or may be in a different repo.

Current model code is stored in my personal GitHub at https://github.com/tgrant7/monarch-ABM

These files were compiled from over 2 years of work, after the first manuscript was published.  While I've tried to organize things, the long development time and learning curve in developing this model has left a somewhat chaotic record.

See the working notes first.  They are long but have a record of all or most important decisions.  

The timeline of R scripts goes about like this:
1.	Monarchs.R
2.	MonarchsGlobalSA.R
3.	YetiSims.R
4.	GlobalSA-Yeti.R
The working R scripts at the time of publication were the last two.
